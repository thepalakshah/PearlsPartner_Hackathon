# Welcome to the MemMachine Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MemMachine! We are a
community-driven open-source project, and we welcome contributions from
everyone. Whether you're a new developer or a seasoned pro, your help is
invaluable.

This guide will walk you through the process of getting started and making your
first contribution.

## 1. Before You Get Started

Before you make a contribution, please take a moment to review these important
documents:

- [**Code of Conduct**](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md): Our community's values and
  expectations for all contributors.
- [**Governance**](GOVERNANCE.md): The rules and principles by which our project
  is managed.

## 2. How to Contribute

We have two main areas for contributions: the core Python source code and the
project's documentation. To make your process as smooth as possible, we have
created specific guides for each.

- **For Core Code Contributions**: If you'd like to contribute code, fix a bug,
  or propose a new feature, please read our
  [**Core Contribution Guide**](CONTRIBUTING-CORE.md).
- **For Documentation Contributions**: If you want to improve a typo, correct a
  broken link, or add a new guide, please read our
  [**Documentation Contribution Guide**](CONTRIBUTING-DOCS.md).

### 3. General Contribution Workflow

All contributions, regardless of type, should follow this general workflow:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the project on GitHub.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Follow the instructions in the relevant guide (Core or
   Documentation).
4. **Sign Your Commits**: All commits must be signed using the `-sS` flags. This
   ensures a verifiable chain of custody for all code. For instructions to
   create GPG Keys used for signing, refer to the
   [Microsoft Commit Signing](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Commit-Signing)
   wiki page for step-by-step instructions.
5. **Push and Open a Pull Request**: Push your changes to your fork and open a
   pull request against our `main` branch.

We look forward to your contributions!
